# SPV Channels CE

Readme version 1.1.1.

| Contents | Version |
|-|-|
| SPV Channels Community Edition | 1.1.0 |

This repository contains SPV Channels CE, which is an implementation of the [BRFC specification](https://github.com/bitcoin-sv-specs/brfc-spvchannels) for SPV channels.
In addition to a server side implementation, it also contains the JavaScript client libraries for interacting with the server. See [Client libraries readme](client/javascript/readme.md) for more details about the client side libraries. 

SPV Channels provides a mechanism via which counterparties can communicate in a secure manner even in circumstances where one of the parties is temporarily offline.

## Swagger UI

The REST API can be reviewed in [Swagger UI](https://bitcoin-sv.github.io/spvchannels-reference/).

# Deploying SPV Channels CE API Server as docker containers on Linux

## Pre Requirements:
A SSL server certificate is required for installation. Obtain the certificate from your IT support team. There are are also services that issue free SSL certificates such as `letsencrypt.org`.  The certificate must be issued for the host with a fully qualified domain name. To use the server side certificate, you need to export it (including the corresponding private key) in PFX file format (*.pfx).

API Clients must trust the Certification Authority (CA) that issued the server side SSL certificate.

## Initial setup

The distribution is shared and run using Docker.

1. Open the terminal.

2. Create a directory where the spvchannels docker images, config and database will be stored (e.g. spvchannels) and navigate to it:

    ```
    mkdir spvchannels
    cd spvchannels
    ```    
   
3. Download the distribution of SPV Channels Server into the directory created in the previous step and extract the contents.

4. Check that the following files are present:

     - `docker-compose.yml`
     - `.env`
     
5. Create a `config` folder and copy the SSL server certificate file (<certificate_file_name>.pfx) into it. This server certificate is required to setup TLS (SSL).

6. Before running the SPV Channels API Server containers (spvchannels-db and spvchannels), replace some values in the `.env` file.

| Parameter | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
|CERTIFICATEFILENAME|File name of the SSL server certificate (e.g. *<certificate_file_name.pfx>*) copied in step 5.|
|CERTIFICATESPASSWORD|Password of the *.pfx file copied in step 5.|
   > **Note:** The remaining setting are explaned in the section [Settings](#Settings).

## Running application
1. After the `.env` is set up, launch the spvchannels-db and spvchannels containers using the command:

    ```
    docker-compose up –d
    ```

The docker images as specified by the `docker-compose.yml` file, are automatically pulled from Docker Hub. 

2. Verify that all the SPV Channels Server containers are running using:

    ```
    docker ps
    ```
    The list should include `bitcoinsv/spvchannels-db` and `bitcoinsv/spvchannels`.
   
3. If everything is running you can continue to section [Account manager](#Account-manager:) to create an account.

> **Note:** If you were provided with an account id and its credentials then you can skip Setting up an account and proceed to [REST interface](#REST-interface)
## Setting up an account
To be able to call SPV Channels Server API, an account must be added into the database using the following command:

   ```
   docker exec spvchannels ./SPVChannels.API.Rest -createaccount [accountname] [username] [password]
   ```

Parameter description:

| Parameter | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| [accountname] | name of the account, any whitespaces in accountname must be replaced with '_' |
| [username] | username of the account |
| [password] | password of the username |

   > **Note:** This command can also be used to add new users to an existing account (e.g. running `docker exec spvchannels ./SPVChannels.API.Rest -createaccount Accountname User1 OtherP@ssword` will return the account-id of Accountname).
## Setting up mobile push notifications
To enable mobile push notifications from SPV Channels, a Firebase service account key is required. Copy the *.json file containing the Firebase service account key into the config folder and set FIREBASECREDENTIALSFILENAME in the `.env` file.

>To get a Firebase service account *.json file, log in to your Firebase console and from Project Setting -> Service account -> Click on generate new private key. This will generate a *.json file with your Firebase service account key.

## REST interface

The reference implementation exposes different **REST APIs**:

* an API for managing channels
* an API for managing messages

This interfaces can be accessed on `https://<servername>:<port>/api/v1`. A Swagger page with the interface description can be accessed at `https://<servername>:<port>/swagger/index.html`
> **Note:** `<servername>` should be replaced with the name of the server where docker is running. `<port>` is set to 5010 by default in the `.env` file.
## Settings
| Parameter | Data type (allowed value) | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| NPGSQLLOGMANAGER | `<bool>` (`True|False`) | Enables additional database logging. Logs are in spvchannels-db container and can be accessed with the command (docker logs spvchannels-db). By default it's set to `False`. |
| HTTPSPORT | `<number>` | Port number on which SPV Channels API is running. By default it's set to `5010`. |
| CERTIFICATEFILENAME | `<text>` | File name of the SSL server certificate (e.g. *<certificate_file_name.pfx>*) |
| CERTIFICATESPASSWORD | `<text>` | Password of the *.pfx file |
| NOTIFICATIONTEXTNEWMESSAGE | `<text>` | Notification text upon arrival of a new message. By default it's set to `New message arrived`. |
| MAXMESSAGECONTENTLENGTH | `<number>` | Maximum size of any single message in bytes. By default it's set to its maximum size `65536`. |
| CHUNKEDBUFFERSIZE | `<number>` | If a message is sent in chunks, this sets the size of a chunk. By default it's set to `1024`. |
| TOKENSIZE | `<number>` | Length of bearer token. By default it's set to `64`. |
| CACHESIZE | `<number>` | Number of records in memorycache. By default it's set to `1048576`. |
| CACHESLIDINGEXPIRATIONTIME | `<number>` | Time in which a record is removed from memorycache if it is not accessed. By default it's set to `60` seconds. |
| CACHEABSOLUTEEXPIRATIONTIME | `<number>` | Time in which a record is removed from memorycache. By default it's set to `600` secunds. |
| FIREBASECREDENTIALSFILENAME | `<text>` | Fully qualified file name of the Firebase service account key. This setting is only required if you wish to enable mobile push notifications. See [Setting up mobile push notifications](#Setting-up-mobile-push-notifications)

## Terminating application

1. Open the terminal and navigate to spvchannels folder:

    ```
    cd spvchannels
    ```

2. To shutdown SPV Channels Server containers use the following command:

    ```
    docker-compose down
    ```

# This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

Solidity is a statically typed, contract-oriented, high-level language for implementing smart contracts on the Ethereum platform.

For a good overview and starting point, please check out the official [Solidity Language Portal](https://soliditylang.org).

## Background

Solidity is a statically-typed curly-braces programming language designed for developing smart contracts
that run on the Ethereum Virtual Machine. Smart contracts are programs that are executed inside a peer-to-peer
network where nobody has special authority over the execution, and thus they allow to implement tokens of value,
ownership, voting, and other kinds of logic.

When deploying contracts, you should use the latest released version of
Solidity. This is because breaking changes, as well as new features and bug fixes are
introduced regularly. We currently use a 0.x version
number [to indicate this fast pace of change](https://semver.org/#spec-item-4).

## Build and Install

Instructions about how to build and install the Solidity compiler can be
found in the [Solidity documentation](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/installing-solidity.html#building-from-source).


## Example

A "Hello World" program in Solidity is of even less use than in other languages, but still:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity >=0.6.0 <0.9.0;

contract HelloWorld {
    function helloWorld() external pure returns (string memory) {
        return "Hello, World!";
    }
}
```

To get started with Solidity, you can use [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/), which is a
browser-based IDE. Here are some example contracts:

1. [Voting](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/solidity-by-example.html#voting)
2. [Blind Auction](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/solidity-by-example.html#blind-auction)
3. [Safe remote purchase](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/solidity-by-example.html#safe-remote-purchase)
4. [Micropayment Channel](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/solidity-by-example.html#micropayment-channel)

## Documentation

The Solidity documentation is hosted at [Read the docs](https://docs.soliditylang.org).

## Development

Solidity is still under development. Contributions are always welcome!
Please follow the
[Developers Guide](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html)
if you want to help.

You can find our current feature and bug priorities for forthcoming
releases in the [projects section](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/projects).
